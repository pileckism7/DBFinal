products falls below the minimum stock level
// PROCEDURES SET UP
// After Order is placed, need to set up procedures to check if the
    IF >> Stock Amount is Less than min_stock >> Callrestock_product(product_id) and populate_restock(product_id)

8. Ability of a customer to place an order, which consists of adding your or your partners’ items to a shopping cart

sells bikes and accessories, and Sakila sells movies.  Your product catalogshould include items fromyour partners’ categories
as well as items from other categories that your partners do not traffic in.Your application should include the following 
basicreports (SQL queries)

10.List of all your products whose inventory has fallen below the minimum stock level
//RETRIEVE the data from restock table, List By Name of the product and some other fields.

11.List of customers who have not been “too active”(you define this)and for whom special offers should be made.

//Return RANDOM 5 items

13.When the products purchased will ship (Shipping will occur four weekdays from now, e.g., if today is Monday, they will ship on Friday.
The above functionality should be implemented using MySQL on elvis.  Additionally, you should create a miniature application in a differentdatabase package of your choice.  That second implementation does not need any insert, update or delete capabilities – but it should include all of the queries to view all of the functionality from 1 to 13 above.


Finally, you will need to enhance your MySQL application to include the following advanced functionality:

14.Ability of a customers to place an item on his/her “wish list.”
15.An algorithm (manifested as a query) to suggest additional products that a customer might be interested in based 
on their order history, their wish list, or anything else you would like to program.
16.Ability of customers to rate products 

17.Ability to view the ratings of products in two ways
  •The average rating based on all rating activity
  •A more intelligent rating that uses an algorithm to weight some customer’s ratings higher than others.And these additional advancedreports:
  
18.A report showing the most highly wished for productsin every category

19.A report showing wished for products that were never purchased by the customers who wished for them
