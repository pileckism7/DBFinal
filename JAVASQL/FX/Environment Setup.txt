Steps to setup Eclipse/JavaFX/SQL Environment

1) Download JDK from Oracle (will contain FX): https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
2) Download SceneBuilder from Gluon: https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/#download
3) Start a new JavaFX project
4) Delete any package that may have been created with the initialization of a new project
5) Create a new package called "db_final"
6) Create a new Class called Main.java in the "db_final" package
7) Download JDBC driver from MySQL: https://www.mysql.com/products/connector/
	7a) The file you want: 'JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J)'
	7b) Select 'Platform Independent' for the OS 
	7c) Download the zip
	7d) Unzip the folder
	7e) Go to Eclipse and right click your project and select properties
	7f) Go to the libraries tab
	7g) Select add an external JAR 
	7h) Go to the location of the JDBC driver, mine looked like this: C:\Users\Christopher\Downloads\mysql-connector-java-8.0.13\mysql-connector-java-8.0.13 - in this folder you should find the 'mysql-connector-java-8.0.13' JAR file. Add this to the library
8) Copy and paste Main.java code from GitHub to Eclipse
9) Create another package called db_final.view which will be a sub-package of db_final
10) Create a fxml file called MainView.fxml inside the db_final.view package
11) Make sure that the fxml file opens with SceneBuilder 8 or 10 (whichever you downloaded from Gluon) - if it doesn't, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBQpA42CJNM
	11a) Create some buttons or other panes on the MainView Scene
12) Make sure that the correct version of SceneBuilder opens when opening the .fxml file
13) VPN into Rowan's network via Cisco AnyConnect or VPN client of your choice
14) in Main.java, replace the connection string with your user information
15) Run Main.java - if all works well then you should see the Scene you created pop up and also see some information from your database appear in the eclipse console
